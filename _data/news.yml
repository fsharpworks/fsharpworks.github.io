    </p>
    <p><em>
      "In the second article, I focus on how to design composable libraries and how (and why) to avoid callbacks in library design.
      This boils down to one thing - build libraries rather than frameworks!"

    <p>
      <em>"Reasoning about the code" means that you can draw conclusions using only the information that you have
        right in front of you, rather than having to delve into other parts of the codebase.
        In other words, you can predict the behavior of some code just by looking at it."

        But just if you still have an empty slot (or in case an originally taken slot has become

    <p>
      <em>A few weeks ago, I came across DiffSharp, an automatic differentiation library in F#.
      As someone who needs to deal with gradients and the like on a regular basis because they are
      quite useful in machine learning and numerical methods, the project looked pretty interesting:
      who wouldn’t want exact and efficient calculations of derivatives?</em>
